    ts is more preffered .


    4. next js

Installation -> 
to install it go to the 
official typescript website 


click on  Try TypeScript Now
Online or via npm


then on your computer via npm 


scroll down and and follow the npm 
here ,
via npm
You can use npm to install TypeScript globally, this means that you can use the tsc command anywhere in your terminal.
To do this, run npm install -g typescript. This will install the latest version (currently 5.2).
npm install -g typescript


then to confirm its Installation type->  tsc  --v  or  tsc  --version

then create a new file , hello world.ts (.ts is for files and .tsx is for jsx elements and note js catches error during runtime 
but typescript catches error using compile time which is a fucking huge advantage) 

then type 'tsc hello_world.ts' to compile it into the js . (terminal understands js not ts )
and it will create a new  compiled js file 'hello world.js'

now to run it type - node hello_world.js 
success
